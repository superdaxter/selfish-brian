# Final Project Submission cpsc 599.82 winter 2021 Group 3
The following document outlines our project tools, paratext, files, subroutines, and contributions.
- [**Makefile**](#makefile)
- [**Tools**](#tools)
- [**Paratext**](#paratext)
- [**Files and Subroutines**](#files-and-subroutines)
- [**Contributions**](#contributions)
## Makefile
To make the executable prg file configure the DEST and URL variables in Makefile to the desired path location. Then run following commands to compile or to remove the prg files.

compile with:
```sh
$ make file=game
```
print the URL location:
```sh
$ make echo
```
remove all prg files:
```sh
$ make
```
## Tools
The following tools were developed by Ronan and Nielson respectively to assist in our project development. The first link is a web application developed by Ronan used to assist us with level design and programmable characters. The second link is a python script that was developed by Nielson used to convert bitmaps into hex strings used in character_set.asm.
